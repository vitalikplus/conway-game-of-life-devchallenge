### The Conway's Game of Life. 
Try it here [link to view the app](https://vitalikplus.github.io/conway-game-of-life-devchallenge/ "conway game of life for devchallenge.it")
This is the simple realization of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) on the fixed field 50x50 cells.
It is possible to expand the game to the field 200x200 cells or higher, however the drop in performance will be noticed.
Written on vanilla js.

#### The main features 
1. Game realization at fixed field size (50x50). 
2. Random filling the field at init. 
3. Play control. Stop | start | reset | next 
4. Play speed setting faster | slower
5. Toggle cell's status manually. 

#### The possible improvements: 
1. Use Canvas instead of div for cells field for performance.   
2. The field size should be unlimited
3. Control the zoom and position of the current field view (pan, zoom, minimap) 
4. Effective history of states saving and navigating (prev|next)
5. Add popular game pattern (samples [at link](http://www.radicaleye.com/lifepage/picgloss/picgloss.html) 
6. Anything else?
